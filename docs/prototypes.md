# Prototype Sources

This document records the approved static prototypes and design references used to define acceptance criteria. Use it alongside `docs/vision.md`.

## Prototype Inventory

| Prototype ID | Link | Fidelity | Scope | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| proto-001 |  | low |  | proposed |  |

## Fidelity Levels

- low: wireframes or sketches that define layout intent
- medium: structured UI with baseline interactions
- high: production-ready visuals and interaction details

## Usage Guidance

- Reference the prototype ID in related user stories and acceptance criteria.
- Capture any deviations and approvals before implementation.
- Update this document when prototypes are superseded or deprecated.
