**Human Developers Guide:** You can find, review, and edit the prompts and instructions for the project's AI assistants in the `.agents/` directory.

**Agent Mandate:** As an AI agent, you **must** follow the instructions in the `.agents/` directory. The primary, foundational files are:

- `.agents/main.md`
- `.agents/developer_assistant.md`

Other `.agents/*.md` files provide domain-specific guidance.

Notes:

- Track and review any changes to the foundational files with human maintainers.
- Preserve user changes in the repo and follow the conflict-resolution rules in `.agents/main.md`.
