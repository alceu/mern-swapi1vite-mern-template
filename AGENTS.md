# General Agents Instructions

## Operational Rules

This file configures the instructions for AI agents working on this project.

The line below tells the agent to load its instructions from all files
located in the `.agents/` directory at the root of the project, as a primary rulebook.

@./.agents/main.md
@./.agents/developer_assistant.md
@./.agents/versioning.md
@./.agents/authorship.md
@./.agents/frontend.md
@./.agents/fullstack.md

**Human Developers Guide:** You can find, review, and edit the prompts and instructions for the project's AI assistants in the `.agents/` directory.

**Agent Mandate:** As an AI agent, you **must** follow the instructions within `main.md`, as they are foundational and apply to all interactions and tasks, serving as the baseline for your operation.
