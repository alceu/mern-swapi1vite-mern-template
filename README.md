# MERN SWAPI Project

This project implements a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack application, leveraging a Vite-based build system for the frontend. Both the frontend and backend are developed using TypeScript, ensuring type safety and improved code quality.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd mern-swapi1vite-mern-template
```

### 2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    cd frontend
    npm install
    cd ..
    ```

### 3. Optional:

    ```bash
    cp -r sample-.vscode .vscode
    ```

### 4. Environment Setup

To get started, you need to create `.env` files from the provided samples for both the backend and frontend. These files will hold your environment-specific variables.

- **For Development:**
  ```bash
  cp sample-development.env .env
  ```
- **For Production:**
  ```bash
  cp sample-production.env .env
  ```
- **Finally, create a symbolic link for the frontend:**
  ```bash
  ln -s ../.env frontend/.env
  ```

**Note:** The `.env` files are ignored by Git, so your secrets are safe. Ensure you configure the variables within these files according to your needs.

### 5. Running the Application

You can run this project in two ways: using Docker (recommended for a consistent environment) or running the services locally on your machine.

#### A. Docker Development (Recommended)

This is the easiest way to get started. With Docker, the entire application (frontend, backend, and database) runs in containers.

**Prerequisites:**

- Docker
- Docker Compose

**Instructions:**

    ```bash
    docker compose up --build
    ```
    The `-d` flag can be added to run in detached mode (in the background).

#### B. Local Development

If you prefer to run the services directly on your machine, follow these steps.

**Prerequisites:**

- Node.js 18+
- npm (or your preferred package manager)
- Docker (for the database)

**Instructions:**

1.  **Start the database:**

    ```bash
    docker compose up mongo -d
    ```

1.  **IMPORTANT:** In your `.env` file, update the `MONGO_URI` to replace `mongo:27017` with `localhost:27017`.

1.  **Start the development servers:**
    - **Backend (in one terminal):**
      ```bash
      npm run dev:backend
      ```
    - **Frontend (in another terminal):**
      ```bash
      npm run dev:frontend
      ```

**Accessing the Application (default, check your `.env`):**

- **Docker and Local Development:**

  - Backend: `http://localhost:5000`
  - Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`

- **Docker Production:**

  - Backend: `http://localhost:5000`
  - Frontend: `http://localhost`

## Project Enhancements and Custom Development

This project extends the base `vite-mern-template` with several key enhancements and custom development tailored for the MERN SWAPI application. These additions focus on implementing specific features, improving code organization, and adhering to modern development practices.

### Key Solutions and Features Implemented:

1.  **[x] State Management with Redux Toolkit**:

    - Utilized Redux Toolkit for centralized and predictable state management across the frontend application.

1.  **[x] Modular Component Architecture**:

    - Organized frontend components into `pages`, `features`, and `components` directories, following a clear separation of concerns.
    - `Pages` handle routing and layout, `Features` encapsulate business logic and data fetching, and `Components` are reusable UI elements.

1.  **[x] Responsive Design**:

    - All frontend components are designed with responsiveness in mind, utilizing `rem` units, Flexbox, Grid, and media queries to ensure optimal viewing across various devices.

1.  **[x] Code Quality and Development Experience**:
    - Integrated Prettier and ESLint for consistent code formatting and linting across both frontend and backend.

## TODO

- [ ] Add testing framework.
- [ ] Implement monorepo structure for better project organization and sharing resources and strong type definitions.
- [ ] Achieve code coverage above 90% across the codebase.
- [ ] Improve data normalization and caching strategies between frontend and backend, using Frontend Top Search Queries Chart feature as example.
