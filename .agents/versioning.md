When changes are made to the repository, the agent will:

1. Draft a commit message based on Conventional Commits guidelines, summarizing the query and the tasks performed in response.
1. Present the proposed commit message to the author.
1. Even if edits are accepted by default, the author will always be prompted for confirmation before committing the changes.
1. If confirmed by the author, the agent will proceed with the commit.
