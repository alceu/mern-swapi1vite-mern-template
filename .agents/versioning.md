# Versioning and Committing Instructions

After successfully completing a task that modifies the repository, you must:

1.  Stage only related changes.
1.  Draft a commit message following Conventional Commits guidelines with 300 characters or less, and present to the user for approval.
1.  **Crucially, you must wait for explicit, affirmative confirmation from the user before proceeding with the commit.**
1.  Commit the changes only once explicit approval has been received.
