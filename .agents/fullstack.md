## Pragmatic Path Aliases

To maintain a clean and manageable codebase, use path aliases to simplify import statements.

### Benefits

- **Simplicity**: This avoids deeply nested relative paths (e.g., `../../../../module`), also described as "import path hell".
- **Readability**: Imports are cleaner and easier to understand.
- **Maintainability**: Simplifies refactoring; moving files rarely requires updating import paths.
- **Consistency**: Enforces a standardized import structure across the project.
