# Authorship Instructions

## About the author

A software engineer and team/project leader/manager in the IT sector, currently seeking international opportunities and learning English.

## Rule

The sole author of any code or documentation changes is the human developer. The AI agent acts as a tool to assist the developer.
Therefore, when adding author references in comments or documentation, you must use the developer's name as the author.
You must *not* use "Co-authored-by" for the AI agent.
